#CSS CRASH COURSE
All of these were done following a Traversy Media css tutorial on youtube. The tutorial was meant as a crash course, I took notes as I followed the video and coded along with it. I will now make up my own project utilizing everything I've learned so far into one website to practice the new information. I will then move on to learning CSS Grid.
